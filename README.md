When you look at the [hello-world](https://github.com/topics/hello-world) topic you see repositories showing all of the coding languages out there. Sadly it only shows you how to print "Hello World."

## Our Goal
Instead of just simply showing you how to print "Hello World". Our goal is to have a multitude of Programming Languages listed with information like their history, their use and more.

## How to Contribute
We know that this project is going to be long and hard, but you can help! If you are.If you are intrested in Contributing click [Here](https://github.com/Maniacxxx/programming-language-list/blob/main/Contribute.md).

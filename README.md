#KNOWLDGE: Programming-Language-List

<!-- The Body [Start] -->

## Our Goal
Instead of just simply showing you how to print "Hello World" in a bunch of languages. Our goal is to have a multitude of Programming Languages listed with information like their history, their use and more.

## Check it out
If you want to see our progress check out the [Language List](https://github.com/Maniacxxx/programming-language-list/blob/main/Language-List.md). From there just click the name of the language to be directed to the Language's markdown file.
